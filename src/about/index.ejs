                    Hi hello! I'm the ImpendingMoon, also known as just some guy.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm a software developer with a degree in Computer Information Systems. I'm not terribly good at
                    programming, <small><em>(don't tell my boss that)</em></small> but I can make things work well
                    enough. I mostly work in .NET, C, and web development.
                    <br><br>
                    I enjoy games, music, and occasionally making things. I really like working with vintage and retro
                    computers, although I tend to pick up more projects than I can handle at once. Because of that, most
                    of my projects are on some sort of haitus at any given moment. I swear I'm working on videos.
                    <br><br>
                    There are so many wasps outside my window right now and they don't even have a nest out there,
                    they're just kinda hanging around and I don't appreciate it.
                    <br><br>
                    I'm not on most social media, but I can be found in my
                    <a href="https://discord.com/invite/N5Rpjek4Bf" target="_blank">Discord Server</a>.

                    This website is written in vanilla HTML, CSS, and JS. with just a <em>little</em> bit of
                    preprocessing using EJS. Remember to feed your pet.

                <p>
                    I generally don't care what anyone does with this website as long as they aren't re-hosting it in
                    its entirety (except for the Internet Archive my beloved).
                    <br><br>

                    Have fun, and don't copy my code too closely, because it isn't that good.
