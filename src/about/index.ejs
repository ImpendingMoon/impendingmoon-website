                    I generally don't care what anyone does with this website as long as they aren't re-hosting it in
                    its entirety (except for the Internet Archive my beloved).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    You acknowledge that you are not Anish Kapoor, you are in no way affiliated to Anish Kapoor, you are
                    not viewing this item on behalf of Anish Kapoor or an associate of Anish Kapoor. To the best of your
                    knowledge, information and belief this website will not make its way into the hands of Anish Kapoor.

                    Anyways, the source code can be found at
                    <a href="https://github.com/ImpendingMoon/impendingmoon-website">GitHub</a>.
                    Have fun, and don't copy my code too closely, because it isn't that good.
